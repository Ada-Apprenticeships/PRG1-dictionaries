"""
Access Log Analyser

Takes a morning's worth of web server log lines and reports on them:
how many requests each page received, which page was busiest, and
which requests failed.

Each line is: time, user, page, status code, separated by spaces.

This program already works. Operations now also want to know which
users are hitting errors, and which of them are hitting more than a
few. That part is not built yet: it is your job to add it, using the
functions already here rather than walking the log again yourself.
